    <p>Static testing is done manually or with a set of tools. Here, the tester checks the code, design documents, requirement document and gives comments on the work document.</p>
    <p>Informal Reviews is where a team of reviewers just checks the documents and give comments. It is non-documented in nature. PR as example</p>
    <p>Walkthroughs is where the author explains about the software to the team and teammates can raise questions if they have any. </p>
    <p>Code is reviewed without execution, it is checked for syntax, coding standard, and code optimization. It is also referred as white box testing.</p>
